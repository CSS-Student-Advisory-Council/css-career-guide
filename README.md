## Introduction

Welcome to the CSS Career Guide! This document will briefly overview the scope of the CSS Career Guide and how it is organized within the CSS SAC.

## Project Overview

The CSS Career Guide is a comprehensive guide tailored for UWB CSS students that covers the entire internship and new grad career hunting process. Within this guide, CSS Students will gain both a broad overview of all stages of the career hunting process and an in-depth analysis of each respective stage to understand required preparation steps, common activities, and other useful tips to best set them up for success. 

For students unsure of their career path, this guide also serves as a starting point into learning about the many possible career paths available to them post-graduation.

This guide was inspired by the advice of many current and former CSS students, and by other similar career guides such as [The Technical Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/). This guide also serves to address the lack of career resources tailored to CSS students that is not sufficiently provided by the UWB CSS department.

## Project Goals

Together with the high-level goals discussed in the project overview, the CSS Career Guide aims to satisfy the following goals:

1. Educate CSS students on the entire internship and new grad career hunting process through common stages for candidates
2. Discuss candidly the shortcomings of the CSS program in preparing students for success in landing internships / jobs
3. Clear up common misconceptions about the requirements needed to succeed in obtaining an internship / job offer
4. Provide information, tips, and resources to prepare students to successfully pass each career hunting stage
5. Provide an extensive list of career resources including career tools, communities, and further information / guides
6. Discuss useful courses within the CSS program and related programs that best prepare students for their future careers
7. Overview the many career paths available for CSS students post-graduation

## Progress Tracking

The current progress on different sections of the guide is tracked within a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/CSS-Student-Advisory-Council/css-career-guide/projects?type=beta) inside this repository.
