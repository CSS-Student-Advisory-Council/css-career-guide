# CSS Career Guide Project Onboarding 

Welcome to the CSS Career Guide Team! This document will briefly overview the scope of the CSS Career Guide and how it is organized within the CSS SAC. 


## Project Overview

The CSS Career Guide is a comprehensive guide tailored for UWB CSS students that covers the entire internship and new grad career hunting process. Within this guide, CSS Students will gain both a broad overview of all stages of the career hunting process and an in-depth analysis of each respective stage to understand required preparation steps, common activities, and other useful tips to best set them up for success. For students unsure of their career path, this guide also serves as a starting point into learning about the many possible career paths available to them post-graduation.

This guide was inspired by the advice of many current and former CSS students, and by other similar career guides such as [The Technical Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/). This guide also serves to address the lack of career resources tailored to CSS students that is not sufficiently provided by the UWB CSS department. 


## Project Goals

Together with the high-level goals discussed in the project overview, the CSS Career Guide aims to satisfy the following goals:



1. Educate CSS students on the entire internship and new grad career hunting process and common stages for candidates
2. Discuss candidly the shortcomings of the CSS program in preparing students for success in landing internships / jobs
3. Clear up common misconceptions about the requirements needed to succeed in landing an internship / job offer
4. Provide information, tips, and resources for each career hunting stage to prepare students for success and enable them to pass the respective stage
5. Provide an extensive list of career resources including career tools, communities, and further information / guides
6. Discuss useful courses within the CSS program and others that best prepare students for industry 
7. Overview the many career paths available for CSS students post-graduation 


## Project Outline

Further information on how this guide is organized can be found in the [guide outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aeSMCyszIyOb5zP60xGf98UZwRVefsJ8cFwvjwEiwBA/edit). 


## Project Artifacts & Hosting

While being edited by members, the main guide document and all associated artifacts (like this onboarding document) are saved within Google Docs documents on the [CSS SAC Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1YYGGIxInS7gnKzL9cA6e3UMMLWlcuhC4). However, this hosting of project documents is undergoing review due to UW Google Suite changes, and will be updated soon (possibly being shifted to GitHub). 

In addition, the guide will be officially deployed on the [CSS SAC website](csssac.org) for all CSS students, faculty, and others to see once a complete version is ready.


## Progress Tracking

The current progress on different sections of the guide is tracked within a dedicated [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/KeV6QV6C/25dd7f5146a471b3a78dcaf4410d4655/css-career-guide). This board uses a kanban-esque structure/flow for specific tasks needed to be done to progress the project. You can also see which tasks are in need of assignees or already have members currently working on them.


## How to Contribute

Contribution guidelines can be found in the [CSS Career Guide Contribution Guidelines document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zWSY8k7dRhhlxNUWxVgoTXrcufHSXedOcKAo1F7C_7w/edit#). 


## Current Team Members

This project is a joint effort between all members of the CSS SAC, but the main members focused on this project are the following:



* Kolby Samson (Project Lead, SAC Core)
