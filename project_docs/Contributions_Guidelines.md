# CSS Career Guide Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for making contributions to the CSS Career Guide. Please read this document before making any changes to the main guide document or other associated project artifacts.


## Project Team Communication

Communication amongst project team members will be in the CSS SAC discord in the #css-faq channel. If you need to collaborate with someone else in the team or need to discuss something else related to the project, please send a text message in the channel.


## Task Organization

Our primary tasks to further develop the guide will be held in our project [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/KeV6QV6C/25dd7f5146a471b3a78dcaf4410d4655/css-career-guide). Please view this board to see tasks needing to be completed.


## Suggesting New Content or Changes

To suggest new content, tasks, or other changes, please add a new Trello card with the project task into the “Backlog” section of the Trello board. Please also add relevant labels, descriptions, checklists, or other information pertinent to the task if needed.


## Propose Tasks for Current Iteration

If you believe the group should prioritize a certain task for the current work iteration on the project, you may move the task from the “Backlog” section to the “To Do” section. However, please do not add too many tasks into the “To Do” section if not immediately important to the guide.


## Beginning Work on a Project Task

If you want to work on one of the tasks defined in the Trello Board, please assign yourself to the card if no one else is working on it. However, for larger or more complex tasks, we may need more than one member on them. If this is the case, reach out to the current member assigned to the task if they need help before assigning yourself. Once you are assigned, you are free to begin working on the main guide content.

The main tasks needed to be done currently will be in the “To Do” and “In Progress” columns. If you choose to work on a task in the “To-Do” task column, please move it to the “In-Progress” column after you assign yourself. 


## Reviewing Contributions

If you are working on a task in the “In Progress” column and have completed the first draft of your work, please move it to the “Under Review” column so that other members can begin reviewing the work and suggesting edits. Similarly, if you see cards in the column already, feel free to begin looking over the new content and making suggestions. However, please do not immediately make changes, but rather leave a Google Docs comment and communicate with the original author so they can review it and approve or contest the change.


## Finalizing Contributions

Once a task has been completed, please move it to the “Done” section to denote it has been reviewed and edited.
