# About Companies

Out of the many companies offering jobs and internships, computer science students often talk about applying to “FAANG”, the “Big N”, “Unicorns”, Startups, and other seemingly esoteric types of companies. In this section, we will cover what all of these terms mean and discuss other major classifications of companies and what makes them different in their recruiting process. Also, we will discuss important factors to consider when evaluating a company on whether or not you should work for them.


## Common Company Types


### FAANG / Big N

FAANG is an acronym short for **F**acebook, **A**mazon, **A**pple, **N**etflix, and **G**oogle; while Big N is a more inclusive term of the top publicly traded tech companies (companies like Microsoft, Twitter, Snapchat, etc). For many students, FAANG and Big N are considered to be the “end goal” for where to work due to their prestige, high compensation, extraordinary benefits, and other factors. However, these companies are also the most competitive in their recruiting processes and thus require applicants to be highly skilled in interviewing and technical skills (and often require prior internship experience as well).


### Unicorns

Unicorns are a special type of privately-held startup companies that have a company valuation of over one billion dollars. Examples of these companies include ByteDance (TikTok), Robinhood, Reddit, and Epic Games. Unicorns also tend to be highly competitive in their recruiting processes and in turn offer valuable compensation and benefits packages. Many unicorns turn into Big N companies once they “IPO” and become publicly traded companies.


### Startups

Startups are companies that are early in their development and are typically much smaller than other established companies. Startups are constantly emerging each year and are very volatile since most are early in developing their product and are actively seeking for funding from investors. Startups can be great places to find an internship early in your degree as they typically are less competitive and may not strictly follow the lengthy interview process of top tech companies. However, many startups only offer unpaid internships or positions with low compensation due to their lack of funding, and can be risky to work for long-term in the case the product flops.


## Company Domains


### Tech Companies
Tech companies are companies whose primary focus is creating technology. There are many types of tech companies due to technology’s broad and encompassing scope. Some companies may identify as tech companies even if their primary focus is not technology, as companies often sink many resources into developing technology for their own purposes. FAANG companies are all examples of large tech companies.
Tech companies may have more thorough technical screening, with an emphasis on technical over behavioral.

### Non-Tech Companies
Non-Tech companies are companies whose primary focus is not technology, but still use technology as part of their process. Some examples include fast food chains and retailers.
Some non-tech companies may not even conduct technical interviews or even online assessments, focusing more on the behavioral portion (DICK’S Sporting Goods, Disney).


### Quants / Trading Firms
Trading firms are companies primarily working with finances and investments. Quants refer to the quantitative models these companies may use to assess finances and investments. Some examples include Two Sigma, Citadel, and Goldman Sachs.
These companies tend to conduct interviews similar to tech companies, as finances often use unique technical products to conduct business. However, they may have an additional emphasis on math and statistics.
