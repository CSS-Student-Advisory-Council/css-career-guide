# Where to Apply

Once you have your resume ready to go, it’s time to start actively sending out your applications to companies to start your career hunting process. In this section, we’ll go over the various places that internship and job postings are available for software roles.


## Application Sites


### Normal Job Boards

Just like most other positions, you can find many internships and job opportunities on normal job posting sites like [LinkedIn](linkedin.com), [Indeed](indeed.com), [Glassdoor](glassdoor.com), and [Monster](monster.com). It is worth checking out multiple of these sites when you are actively searching for a position as some companies/roles open on different platforms at different times. 

In addition to these normal job sites, as a student, you also have access to [Handshake](https://uw.joinhandshake.com/), which is another career platform with many resources for students. This site is also where you can register for many career events that are offered by UWB.


### GitHub Job Boards

Another very helpful resource that specifically targets students looking for software internships and FTE roles are GitHub job boards. These boards are created by various communities of students or other individuals on GitHub that aggregate internship and/or job opportunities within a single document so you can quickly mass apply. Some of these GitHub profiles that offer job boards include [Pitt CSC](https://github.com/pittcsc/) and [BaruYogesh](https://github.com/baruyogesh/), who have GitHub repositories created for almost every internship and FTE season each year. All of the job posts can be found in the README of the respective repositories, so you can check for new commits to the repository for new openings.


### Startup Job Board: AngelList

As an exception to the normal job boards, there also exists [AngelList](angel.co), a job site specifically for advertising internship / job opportunities at startup companies. If you want to try working at a startup company, you should definitely check out this resource as it is updated frequently with new startup companies and positions.		


## CS Discord Community Job Channels

On top of sites dedicated to internship / job opportunities, many CS-oriented Discord communities have channels dedicated to posting new opportunities sourced either from automated job scrapers or members of the community. 


### Automated Job Scrapers

An example of an automated job scraper is the helper bot on the [cscareers.dev](https://cscareers.dev/discord) Discord server. This bot will automatically pulls internship / job opportunities from various sources and posts them to the Discord server for the members to see. However, this bot can be slightly slow or miss some opportunities, so it is important to actively look at the other resources.


### Other Communities

Other communities that have career posting channels include:



* [UWB ACM](https://discord.gg/kEaTeY8)
* [CS Career Hub](https://discord.com/invite/ndFR4RF)


## Career Fairs

Career fairs can also be valuable resources to talk directly with company recruiters and apply in-person with a hard copy of your resume. Many career fairs exist, but this subsection will focus on career fairs directly offered at UWB (and UWS).


### UWB Career Fairs

The two main career fairs useful for All Industries Fair and the Tech & Engineering Fair. More information about these fairs can be found [here](https://www.uwb.edu/careers/employers/career-fairs). These fairs are offered once a year in the fall (usually in October) and have representatives from a [variety of companies](https://www.uwb.edu/careers/events/past-events/tech-and-engineering-fair-2019). 


### UWS (CSE) Career Fair

A lesser-known opportunity for CSS students is that you actually _can_ attend the exclusive CSE “established company fair” at UW Seattle -- but only during a shorter restricted time period where the fair gets opened to all other non-CSE students. If possible, you can try to attend this fair to try and speak with the many other [affiliated companies](https://www.cs.washington.edu/industrial_affiliates/current) that attend.
