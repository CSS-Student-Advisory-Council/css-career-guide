# Introduction


## What is this guide for?

The amount of career resources specifically tailored for CSS students is very limited. This document attempts to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive guide covering the entire career hunting process contextualized to CSS students, with special considerations to the constraints and resources present within the CSSE program. In addition, this document provides an [extensive list of career resources](Appendix/A-Resource_List.md) and [tips](Appendix/D-Other_Tips.md) to assist you in your career search.

This guide was partly inspired by [a post on r/uwb](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwb/comments/kyd1j2/thoughts_on_the_csse_program_as_someone_working/) which described the many career-oriented misconceptions and shortcomings within the CSSE program. Through this guide, we hope to address these issues for all future CSS students.

For those who are still undecided on a desired career and want to learn more about different fields of study within CSS, this guide also provides coverage over many [career paths](Appendix/B-Career_Paths.md) available for CSS students. We will also connect these career paths to a variety of [useful courses](Appendix/C-Coursework.md) present in the CSS program if you want to learn more about them in a formal classroom setting.
