As of the last offering of this class, the first half of the quarter is focused on eBay as a case study and learning the differences between Monolithic and Microservices architectures, studying basic messaging between different services, as well as modifying systems from monolithic to microservices architecture. The second half of the class is focused on Amazon as a case study and learning further techniques for scaling systems such as the Publish-Subscribe model and using NoSQL for certain features. Although there is no coding done in this class, a strong background in databases, SQL, and data modelling is a must in order to understand the topics and do well in the 6-7 assignments that require purely original redesigns and refactoring of systems based on case studies covered in class.

The second half of the quarter is focused on applying these concepts using SQL and learning different types of queries such as SELECT queries, different types of joins, complex queries, views, and different types of ways to modify databases such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. The final project focuses on applying your knowledge of database systems to make an open-ended project of your choice. Many professors require a user interface to interact with your database for the final project, which is a very good opportunity to apply tools and concepts like HTML, CSS, MVC architecture, and even full-stack web development to your final project and have a good in-depth project to put on your resume.
